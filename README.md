# css-animation-generator

This code will generate a CSS keyframe for when you want to move an HTML element around in a circle, triangle, square, etc.

Radius: integer => Value in pixels of the rotation radius
Steps: integer => How many edges does the path have
OffsetX: integer => Offset on the X axis
OffsetY: integer => Offset on the Y axis
rotation: integer => 1 for counter-clockwise, -1 for clockwise

Feel free to use this in any project, website, whether for personal or commercial use without giving me credit (if anyone even finds this useful)

Any suggestions for extensibility are welcome in the issues folder of this repository.
